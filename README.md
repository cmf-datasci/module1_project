# Movie Database Analysis 

## Business Question

Microsoft is creating a new movie studio and we were tasked with providing insights to help them understand the movie industry. Specifically, we tasked with exploring online, public movies databases to find actionable insights to help Microsoft determine what type of films to create.

Given this, we addressed three questions:

- What movie genres should Microsoft focus on?
- What is the relationship between production budget and box office revenue?
- What actors/actresses should Microsoft hire for their initial movies?

## Recommendations

To summarize, we found the following:
    
- Movie ratings may not be the best indicator indicator of commericial success. Therefore, Microsoft should focus on the action,adventure, sci-fi, animation and fantasy genres
- There is a correlation between box office success and larger production budgets. Many of these films tend to Disney films. Therefore, Microsoft should focus on larger production budget films
- Some actors/actresses have a strong track record of producing very popular films. Therefore, Microsoft should aim to hire: Winston Duke, Sean Gunn, Alfie Allen, Danai Gurira, Kerry Condon and Florence Kasumba.

## Next Steps

If we had more time, we would do the following:
    
- Do a deep-dive on Disney movies to determine why they are so successful
- Explore data from streaming platforms to better improve the popularity measure
- Explore non-traditional sources of data (e.g., scrapping sentiment from Twitter)
- Expand size of datasets (esp. RT) and examine the trends over time
- Analyse the data to help Microsoft come up with a content acquisition strategy (i.e., build vs. buy)
